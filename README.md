# CZ2006-SE

This repo covers the project submission required for CZ2006 Software Engineering. This module requires heavy documentation in addition to a final working product.

For our group, we created an application "Green Routine" that encourages users to recycle their goods at their nearest Cash-for-Trash site. The application includes estimation and other helpful information and forum function. A large part of the code was done by my good friend Terry, and not me. As such, this repo contains only documentations necessary for the project.

## Description

The following are included in this repo:
1. Project Specification Document
